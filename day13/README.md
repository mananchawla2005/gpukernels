# Day 13:
# TASK: Matrix Transpose CUDA Implementation

This task implements an efficient matrix transpose operation using CUDA. Matrix transposition is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and deep learning, where rows and columns of a matrix are swapped.

## Prerequisites
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- CUDA Toolkit installed
- Python 3.6+ with pip
- PyTorch installed
- A C++ compiler compatible with your Python version

## WHY MATRIX TRANSPOSE?

Matrix transpose is essential for many reasons:
- Fundamental operation in linear algebra computations
- Required for many deep learning operations
- Used in data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Critical for optimizing memory access patterns
- Necessary for certain matrix multiplication algorithms

## Implementation Features
- Efficient 2D grid and block configuration
- Coalesced memory access patterns
- Simple and straightforward thread mapping
- Direct indexing for input and output
- Handles arbitrary matrix dimensions

## Setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Unix/Linux
```

2. Build and install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Testing and Usage Example
Run the test script to verify the installation:

```bash
python test.py
```

The test will create a random matrix, transpose it using our CUDA implementation, and compare it with PyTorch's native transpose operation.

Make sure you are in the activated virtual environment when running the code.
